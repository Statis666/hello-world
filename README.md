# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Letâ€™s get started with GitHub!

.... write a bit about yourself.

I am editing this file localy in VSC (Visual Studio Code).

Q: How I opened it?
A: Through GitHub Desktop, 
by clicking on the Current repository 
(to get the right icon arrow pointing up) 
and then right clicking "hello-world" 
and selecting "Open in Visual Code"

Currently I have not installed the Git.
